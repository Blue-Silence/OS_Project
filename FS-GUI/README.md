A toy log-structured file system in Golang.

This was part of the project for TJSE-OS-Project-3(File system).   
But I think it's better to isolate the **real file system** part from the GUI demo required by the teacher, for reasons I dont't know.   
*AND I HATE GUI.*
For now I use a virtual disk interface(with no serialization mechanism). I will add it later.
